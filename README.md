### About The Project

![She Climbs Screen Shot][she-climbs-website-screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

This is the very first 'major' project that I ever worked on. It's called *She Climbs*, and is a website dedicated and inspired by rock climbing, in particular female rock climbers from around the world.

I incorporated HTML, CSS and even a short interactive section of Javascript (this was added directly into the HTML file using the `<script></script>` element).

Click the button at the bottom to see my JS function in action!
