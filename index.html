        <span class="paragraphTitle"><strong>Rock climbing</strong></span
        >, or simply 'climbing', is a sport where people will climb up, across,
        or down a natural or artificial rock face.
        <br />
        <br />
        This sport has multiple disciplines including <em>bouldering</em>,
        <em>sport climbing</em>, <em>traditional (or trad) climbing</em>, and
        <em>deep water soloing</em>. Climbers solve 'problems' as they progress
        through a route, and have to figure out optimum body positioning and
        movements or 'moves' to successfully 'send' or finish a route without
        falling. <br />
        <br />
        People have been climbing for centuries, and it has most recently become
        a sport at the Olympic Games! There are a plethora of incredible female
        climbers that inspire people all over the world. These women are record
        breakers, and send some of the most difficult routes known to the
        climbing world. They are certainly paving the way for the future of
        climbing! <br />
        <br />
        I hope this page inspires you to try rock climbing yourself one day!
        Here's to women climbers all over the world 💪
